# Learning_JavaScript
Learning a new language week 

During this week (from the time of writing it will be 16/09/2024 Monday through to Friday). I will
be learning JavaScript to help reinforce old concepts such as functions and classes, which I learned
in Python. 

I will also be learning new concepts such as asynchronocity and promises. This week will also
be fundamental in teaching me how to learn a programming language by noticing similar concepts and applying
a methodical approach to tackling said programming languages's differing qualities such as syntax or new concepts

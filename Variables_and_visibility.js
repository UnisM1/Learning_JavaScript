// == Learn to declare variables and print them in JavaScript. ==

// TIP: run 'npx prettier --write .  ' in the terminal to format your .js file, useful if you tend to forget to add semi colons at the end of every line which is part of JS syntax.

// == Exercise ==

// In the node REPL, declare two variables â€” a with value 4 and b with value 6.
// Using console.log, print the result of:
// a + b (should print 10)
// a * b (should print 24)


// == CHALLENGE == 

// Can you find the problem in the following program? Make the fix, so the code prints "Hello Makers" when typed into the node REPL.

// const greeting = 'Hello ';
// const name = 'Makers';

// console.log greeting + name;

// I notice that there are brackets missing after 'console.log' on line 20.
